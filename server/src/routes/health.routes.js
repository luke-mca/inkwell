// Routes are boundary classes (Lecture 4, Section 4.3): they 
//translate
// HTTP requests into calls against Services, and Service res
//ults back
// into HTTP responses. This route currently has no Service t
//o call —
// health-check logic is trivial enough to stay in the route 
//itself,
// a deliberate, documented exception, not an oversight.
